# Testing

## Code Validation

The [Tennis For All](https://lucia2007.github.io/tennis-for-all/index.html) webpage was thouroughly tested. HTML code was reviewed in the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org). The CSS code was validated in the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). There were a few minor errors found regarding incorrect semantic use of section and span. All mistakes were corrected and both HTML and CSS files currently have no errors.
