# Tennis For All

The purpose of this website is to encourage people of all ages, skills and standards to consider taking up tennis. It introduces tennis as an accessible option for everyone. It shows you don’t have to be a pro with years of coaching to be able to enjoy this game. The social aspect of the events is clearly emphasized as well. 

The site is targeted towards people who might not be very physically active and who are lacking social connection. 

Tennis For All is useful for all people in a particular neighbourhood who want to meet new friends and be more fit by providing information about different game options available for men, women and children, but also for those who want to play tennis at a more competitive level.

##Wireframes

![Tablet and mobile wireframe page 3](assets/readme-images/mockup_p3_tablet_mobile.png)

The wireframes were created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). Originally, I started with focusing on the desktop version. After encouragement from a tutor, I changed my approach to mobile first. This approach later led to simpler media queries.

On the second page I added a fourth tennis group to make the page more even for larger screens. 

I left out pictures in the Improvement section for larger screens as they were disruptive having been placed right under another set of pictures in the Find Your Group section.

After consultation with my mentor, I additionaly created a separate section for the self-improvement tips, instead of placing them in the footer. 

I also left out the "How to Find Us" section, as it was bringing focus to a particular club, whereas the purpose of the site is to arouse interest in tennis itself, the venue being secondary. 

Lastly, I added an extra Thank you page where a user is taken after filling in the form to create a more pleasant user experience.

## Site Structure

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The chosen fonts were downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). "Albert Sans", weight 300, is used for the body and for the headings it is 'Nunito Sans', both with a fall back to sans-serif. Both fonts create an inviting, non-intimidating feeling and are easily legible.

 * ### Color Scheme
      The chosen color scheme reflects the colors most often seen on tennis courts: green, orange, blue. The complementary colors were chosen using [Color pallete generator](coolors.co).

# Testing
<!-- Testing 
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
CSS

Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. -->

Other General Project Advice
Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through this article by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood
When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
