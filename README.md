# Tennis For All

The purpose of this website is to encourage people of all ages, skills and standards to consider taking up tennis. It mainly wants to show that tennis can be accessible to all. You don’t have to be a pro with years of coaching to be able to enjoy this game. The social aspect of the events should be emphasized as well. The site will be targeted towards people who might not be very active physically and who are lacking social connection. Tennis For All will be useful for all people in a particular neighbourhood who want to meet new friends and be more active by providing information about different options available for men, women and children and also for those who want to play tennis at a more competitive level.

Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. -->

Other General Project Advice
Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through this article by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood
When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
