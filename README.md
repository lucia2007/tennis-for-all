# Tennis For All

The purpose of this website is to encourage people of all ages, skills and standards to consider taking up tennis. It introduces tennis as an accessible option for everyone. It shows you donâ€™t have to be a pro with years of coaching to be able to enjoy this game. The social aspect of the events is clearly emphasized.

The site is targeted towards people who might not be very physically active and who are lacking social connection.

Tennis For All is useful for all people in a particular neighbourhood who want to meet new friends and be more fit by providing information about different game options available for men, women and children, but also for those who want to play tennis at a more competitive level.

# User Experience

## Wireframes

The wireframes were created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). Originally, I started with focusing on the desktop version. After encouragement from a tutor, I changed my approach to mobile first. This approach later led to simpler media queries.

In comparison with the original design, I added a button ("Give Tennis a Try"/"Get Involved"), which serves as call to action, to both the first and the second page. Also a fourth tennis group on the second page was added to make the page more balanced for larger screens.

After consultation with my mentor, I additionaly created a separate section for the self-improvement tips, instead of placing them in the footer.

I also left out the "How to Find Us" section, as it was bringing focus to a particular club, whereas the purpose of the site is to arouse interest in tennis itself, the venue being secondary.

Lastly, I added an extra "Thank you" page where a user is taken after filling in the form to create a more pleasant user experience.

## Design Choices

- ### Typography

  "Albert Sans", weight 300, is used for the body and 'Nunito Sans' for the headings, both with a fall back to sans-serif. Both fonts create an inviting, non-intimidating feeling and are easily legible. The chosen fonts were downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- ### Color Scheme
  The chosen color scheme reflects the colors most often seen on tennis courts: green, orange, blue. The complementary colors were chosen using [Color pallete generator](coolors.co).

### Future Features

- Adding a back to top button would enhance the user's experience as they would not have to scroll back all the way to the top.

- The styling of "Find Your Group" section was inspired by [Czechitas](https://czechitas.cz).

## Acknowledgements

- Extra help and guidance was received from my mentor Precious Ijege, from tutors and fellow colleagues from the Code Institute. Many an insight was received from my friend Aoife.
- I received help from tutors with my images which were blurry ("object-fit: cover" property, with responsivness (the use of grid instead of flex especially for the "available groups" and the gallery section was recommended), with navigation bar which was "jumping" and becoming bigger when hovered on and with my footer overflowing due to a set size of one of the elements (more details in the [Testing File](TESTING.md))
- To make the buttons on Home and Find Your Group page clickable, I used the [solution #1](https://testbook.com/web-development/how-to-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link) from the indicated website (onclick="window.location.href = 'group.html';").
- A tutorial for creating a fixed/sticky header and footer was found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_fixed_menu.asp) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSIB9zPYu4w).
- [Kevin Powell's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU) were instrumental in the use of flexbox.

Thank you all for your support and encouragement.
