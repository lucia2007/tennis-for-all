# Tennis For All

The purpose of this website is to encourage people of all ages, skills and standards to consider taking up tennis. It introduces tennis as an accessible option for everyone. It shows you donâ€™t have to be a pro with years of coaching to be able to enjoy this game. The social aspect of the events is clearly emphasized as well. 

The site is targeted towards people who might not be very physically active and who are lacking social connection. 

Tennis For All is useful for all people in a particular neighbourhood who want to meet new friends and be more fit by providing information about different game options available for men, women and children, but also for those who want to play tennis at a more competitive level.

# User Experience

## Wireframes

The wireframes were created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). Originally, I started with focusing on the desktop version. After encouragement from a tutor, I changed my approach to mobile first. This approach later led to simpler media queries.

On the second page I added a fourth tennis group to make the page more even for larger screens. 

I left out pictures in the Improvement section for larger screens as they were disruptive having been placed right under another set of pictures in the Find Your Group section.

After consultation with my mentor, I additionaly created a separate section for the self-improvement tips, instead of placing them in the footer. 

I also left out the "How to Find Us" section, as it was bringing focus to a particular club, whereas the purpose of the site is to arouse interest in tennis itself, the venue being secondary. 

Lastly, I added an extra Thank you page where a user is taken after filling in the form to create a more pleasant user experience.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The chosen fonts were downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). "Albert Sans", weight 300, is used for the body and for the headings it is 'Nunito Sans', both with a fall back to sans-serif. Both fonts create an inviting, non-intimidating feeling and are easily legible.

 * ### Color Scheme
      The chosen color scheme reflects the colors most often seen on tennis courts: green, orange, blue. The complementary colors were chosen using [Color pallete generator](coolors.co).

# Credits

## Content

* The overall inspiration came from my local [Tennis Club](https://shankilltennisclub.com/) which is extremely welcoming and accomodating of new players. Visiting this club significantly helped our family with making friends, having fun, keeping fit and assimilating in the new country.
* The inspiration for the navigation and the form came from *Love Running Project*.
* The styling of Find Your Group section was inspired by [Czechitas](https://czechitas.cz).
* The fonts were downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* The location of the local tennis club is taken from [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).
* The Find Your Group page content was partly taken from this [site](https://shankilltennisclub.com/).
* The color pallete was downloaded from [coolors](https://coolors.co).
* The icons were found at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) was used to create the wireframes.
* The framework for the readme file was taken from [Wawas Wood](https://github.com/EwanColquhoun/wawaswoods/blob/master/README.md).

## Media

## Acknowledgement
* Extra help and guidance was received from my mentor Precious Ijege, from tutors and fellow colleagues from the Code Institute. Many an insight was received from my friend Aoife. 
* I received help from tutors with my images (object fit: cover property and the use of grid helped), with navigation bar which was "jumping" and becoming bigger when hovered on and with my footer overflowing due to a set size of one of the elements.
* To make the buttons on Home and Find Your Group page clickable, I used the [solution #1](https://testbook.com/web-development/how-to-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link) from the indicated website (onclick="window.location.href = 'group.html';").
* A tutorial for creating a sticky footer was found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSIB9zPYu4w).
* [Kevin Powell's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU) were instrumental in the use of flexbox.

Thank you all for your support and encouragement.
